# Pinterest UI Recreation
### Introduction
This project is a recreation of the Pinterest user interface using Swift and SwiftUI. It was developed as the final project for the Fall 2022 AppTeam Carolina iOS Development Academy, where I learned the foundations of programming in Swift.

### Project Description
The Pinterest UI Recreation project attempts to mimic the visual and functional aspects of Pinterest's user interface. The project leverages Swift and SwiftUI to create a dynamic, visually appealing layout similar to what users experience on Pinterest. It includes several key features, such as a grid layout for displaying images, dynamic content loading, and responsive design to ensure compatibility across various device sizes.
